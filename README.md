# Canvas Calendar To Apple Reminders

Takes input of a path for the Canvas calendar ics file, and an end date to stop adding events past.
It then adds each event into Apple Reminders using AppleScript.
(MacOS Only)

## How to Use

### Step 1

Create a list in Apple Reminders called "Canvas". If you prefer a different name for the list, edit main.py.

### Step 2

Go to Canvas, then Calendar, then click Calendar Feed, then click "Click to view Calendar Feed". After this, it will save a .ics file to your computer.

### Step 3

Run the program, and then paste the full file path of the file you just downloaded (Do not use ~ for the user directory).

### Step 4

Type in the date you want the program to add reminders through. Enter it in the format MM/DD/YYYY.

### Step 5

Wait a little bit and the reminders should appear in your "Canvas" list.
